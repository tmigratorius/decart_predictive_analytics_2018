    "- MRI physics\n",
    "    - MRIs rely on strong magnetic fields to align body atoms, signals from spins is detected and translated into an image. The signal acquired is in the Fourier domain, taking the inverse Fourier transform gives the image\n",
    "    - Because each case has to be analyzed and measured individually, it's very slow. There has been a great deal of work to speed up MRI time by reducing sampling points, but this leads to issues\n",
    "    - though there are issues, MRI gives great soft tissue contrast\n",
    "- MRIs and Deep Learning\n",
    "    - More flexibility, better images, and better patient satisfaction\n",
    "    - Classification networks were initially used to improve the process\n",
    "    - Regression networks are a newer way to improve MRIs\n",
    "        - this changes the loss function, changes the problem to a regression problem to minimize the loss\n",
    "- Examples from the MRI field\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Knee Super Resolution\n",
    "     \n",
    "    the problem is to take a poor, pixelated image and produce something sharper and clearer, traditional algorithms are slow and the problem is ill-defined. Taking a deep learning approach may have a high time requirement in the training phase but end processing is quick\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The CNN was trained on pairs of images (high res, low res), taught the CNN to calculate the residual. Problem tries to minimize the difference between the true residual and the modeled residual. As with ALL data science, the available data is the real issue. Compared several interpolation strategies (tricubic interpolation, Fourier interpolation, DeepResolve-the CNN). The CNN did tend to better preserve pathologies in the images\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Cardiac perfusion MRI temporal inetropolation\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Heart imaging is difficult as the heart is constantly moving. Contrast material is used to highlight diseased areas. Taking multiple slices at the same time is hard, traditional algorithms cannot capture the desired number of slices. This project took images at different times and then merged the images to interpolate intermediate states. This doubled the number of slices captured each beat. Deep learning has a much better time interpolating the optical flow. This network 'Separable convolution interpolation' (U-net architecture), and calculates the convolutional kernel per pixel. Because each pixel is evaluated, it is very customizable/extensible to many applications. The original training data was youtube videos, and SepConv was then fine-tuned on medical images. Training from scratch needs a large training dataset\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The SepConv approach also better perserved pathologies in the images, produced fewer artifacts, and had less residual.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Accelerating Stroke Imaging\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Diffusion contrast better reflects the physiology of imaged area. Diffusion weighted contrast has a much higher image slice requirement. Estimation techniques are used to reduce imaging time, but a great deal of detail is lost. Image generation is also very slow. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The proposed deep learning approach is to subsample, run a reduced number of images through a convolutional neural network. Undersampling and processing with the CNN, the scan could be reduced from 12min to 3 min with minimal detail loss. The 2D deep learning approach preserves much of the detail and structure and is significantly better than the 1D method. Simultaneous training also greatly improved results, as the simultaneous parameter maps were self-reinforcing.\n",
